### With the API

`https://icons.hackclub.com/api/icons/:color/:glyph`
 - `:glyph` - A glyph from [icons.hackclub.com](https://icons.hackclub.com).
 - `:color` - Any valid HTML color or [Hack Club Theme](https://theme.hackclub.com) color prefixed with `hackclub-`. Replace `#` with `0x` when using a hexadecimal color.

All responses are SVGs with the MIME type `image/svg+xml`. You can optionally include the .svg file extension.

## Adding an icon

If you’d like to add an icon, the Figma file is [Hack Club Icons](https://www.figma.com/file/H2wiriGOtV3txSx6fwVTwsPz/Hack-Club-icons?node-id=0%3A1&t=m5yDilUsUNQxrUUu-1). Try to design the icon only out of components of other icons, to keep consistency high, with those small square canvas sizes. When you’re done, clone your new icon, flatten all the layers into one shape for the simplest/smallest code/rendering, then export as an SVG with no background. Open the file, copy the `<path>`, then in the Icon source file, add a new one (alphabetically), using a wrapping `<g>` if you have several `<path>`s. Make sure to remove the fill attribute from all paths, & ensure you’re formatting props correctly as JSX (replacing hyphens with camelCase).

After publishing, remember to update the package dependency on the docs site so it’s showing the latest iconset.
